# NETFLIX_Movies_And_TV_Shows_Clustering

## Problem Statement

**This dataset encompasses television shows and movies accessible on Netflix as of 2019. The data originates from Flixable, a third-party search engine dedicated to Netflix content discovery.**

**Back in 2018, an interesting report was published, revealing that the number of TV shows on Netflix had nearly tripled since 2010. Interestingly, during the same time frame, the number of movies available had decreased by more than 2,000 titles, while TV show availability had experienced a threefold increase. It's fascinating to think about what other insights we might uncover from this dataset.**

**If we merge this dataset with data from other sources like IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomatoes scores, we could discover even more interesting findings.**
